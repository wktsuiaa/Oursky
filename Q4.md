>The bug is the value of i inside the function(x) is equal to the value of i in the createArrayWithNewI(x) after the iteration.
>
>Because javascript is function scope that the variable i in function(x) is equal to the variable i in createArrayWithNewI(x).
>
>So when the call createArrayWithNewI(3) is finished, the value of i has been changed to 3 and the result of arr[0](1) will be 4 instead of 1.
>
>To fix this bug, we can use let keyword instead of var in the for loop to declare the variable i.
>
>So that we block scope.
